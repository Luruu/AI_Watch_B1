# Data acquired from Unity 3D of a single avatar node.

this folder contains tests carried out with data acquired from the virtual environment (unity) before the tracker (module A1) was developed. So they are to be considered obsolete for the current version of the aiwatch project.

Anyway, these coordinates could be used for further tests between module B1 and module C1, but I recommend to use data acquired from tracker (i.e. real environment) [here](../simulation).
